# Degen token verification using fuji network

The DegenTokens smart contract creates a custom ERC20 token on the Avalanche blockchain. It allows the owner to mint and reward tokens, track player rewards, facilitate player-to-player trading, and redeem tokens for in-game rewards. This enhances player engagement and loyalty within the Degen Gaming ecosystem.

## Description

In this we are verifying the smart contract using fuji network and snowtrace to tract the activity of the account of metamask


### procedure 
open remix and write a smart contract of degen tokens
now connect that smart contract to a metamask account selecting inject with metamask wallet
copy the address and paste it on snowtrace 
it will show the activity of the smart contract connected with wallet
it will always ask for the cost and permission deploying and doing things
